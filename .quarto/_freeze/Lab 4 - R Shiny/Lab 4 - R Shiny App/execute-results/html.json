This data set is already built into **R**. You can load it by typing `data(mtcars)`. Once you do that, you should change the `cyl`, `vs`, `am`, `gear`, and `carb` variables to be factors rather than numeric.\n\nYour job is to build an app that has the following:\n\n-   A title for the app.\n-   An input select box that lets the user specify which variable in the data set they are selecting.\n-   An input select box that lets the user specify what type of plot to use, either a histogram, box plot, or bar plot.\n-   The app should then output the plot of the variable that is selcted. The plot should have a nice color, a title, and easy to read axes.\n-   If the variable is quantiative and a bar plot is selected, then a message should appear to the user indicating the wrong type of plot is selected.\n-   Likewise, if the variable is categorical and a histogram or box plot is selected, then a message should appear to the user indicating the wrong type of plot is selected.\n\nSome hints:\n\n-   The app will need a `ui` element, a `server` function, and the last line should be `shinyApp(server = server, ui = ui)`.\n-   Add items to your app one at a time and run it often to make sure things are working as expected.\n-   You'll need both a `renderText()` and a `renderPlot()` function in the server.\n-   `if` statements are very useful in these shiny apps.\n-   The variable selected by the user will be saved as an object in `input$`. You should use the `reactive()` functions to save it as an object in the `server` function and then access it in the `render...()` functions by typing its name with parentheses `()` at the end. For example, if you save it as `var_select` then you will access it as `var_select()` in the `reactive()` functions.\n-   In `ggplot`, we are used to calling the name of the variable we are plotting in the `aes()` function. However, the variable we are plotting is being chosen by the user and is reactive. You can access the variable you want by putting `mtcars` as the first argument in `ggplot` and then by putting `aes(x = .data[[var_select()]])`, if you saved your variable as `var_select` in the server function. That `.data` will refer back to whatever data set you entered into the `ggplot` function. So, it will look like `ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = .data[[var_select()]]))`. Of course, you can change that `x` to an `y` where appropriate.\n\nOne more thing about R Markdown. If you change the **R** code chunk option from `eval = F` to `eval = T` after building your app, the code will run, but the app will not be interactive. It is just a static file. You can make it interaction by adding `runtime: shiny` (not indented) to the bottom of the YAML (under the `editor_options:` section). If you save the file, the Knit button at the top should change to a play button that says \"Run Document\". If you click that, it will make the document interactive. You cannot save and share the output of document in this state, though.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(shiny)\n```\n:::\n\n",
